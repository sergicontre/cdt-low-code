### Description

This project aims to provide a toolbox for simulating the behavior of industrial assets, enabling the construction of digital twins, predictive models, and other related analyses. The project is based on the implementation of an OPC-UA server simulating data from a programmable logic controller (PLC), along with Node-RED and a MongoDB database. Everything is set up and run using Docker Compose.

### Components

1. **OPC-UA Server**: Simulates a PLC by generating random data in different nodes. It also allows for the generation of anomalies and the configuration of user-defined nodes. It is used to simulate the behavior of industrial assets.

2. **Node-RED**: Flow-based programming tool that allows for connection to the OPC-UA server and data transfer to the MongoDB database. Provides a user interface to configure and visualize data flows.

3. **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used to store the data generated by the OPC-UA server. It allows for data analysis and querying for the construction of predictive models and digital twins.

### Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your local machine.

### Configuration

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Run `docker-compose up` to build and start the Docker containers.
4. Once the containers are up and running, you can access Node-RED at `http://localhost:1880` and MongoDB at `http://localhost:27017`.

### Usage

1. Configure the OPC-UA server in Node-RED to generate random data and set up user-defined nodes as needed.
2. Use Node-RED to transfer data from the OPC-UA server to MongoDB.
3. Use MongoDB to store and analyze the simulated data.
4. Create digital twins, predictive models, and other analyses using the data stored in MongoDB.
